# MathGame

This command line program is essentially an improvised version of [Crazy Numbers](https://github.com/shash-b/crazy_numbers) but written in Java! It's a great application for passing time by solving simple arithmetic problems or challenging yourself to do tedious and formidable calculations in your head with the pressure of time.

This game consists of the following features:
- Local high-score saves
- Calculates time taken to answer each question accurately
- Multiple levels for each arithmetic operation
- New random operations choice that gives double points
